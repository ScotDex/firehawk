## üìñ About Firehawk

Firehawk is a self-hosted Discord bot for EVE Online, providing real-time killmail alerts and useful in-game information lookups. Inspired by the excellent [Firetail Bot](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/firetail-eve-discord-bot/45283), this project was built as a learning exercise to explore high-performance, concurrent applications in Go.

It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and easily run by anyone using Docker.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Self-Hosting)

Firehawk is designed to be self-hosted using Docker. Follow these instructions to get your own instance running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose installed on your system.
* A **Discord Bot Token**. You can get one by creating a new application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
*test

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the bot, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ScotDex/firehawk.git](https://github.com/ScotDex/firehawk.git)
    cd firehawk
    ```

2.  **Create Your Configuration File**
    Copy the example configuration file to create your own. This file will store your secret bot token.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Edit the `.env` File**
    Open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor and add your Discord bot token and a contact email (this is required by the ESI API).
    ```env
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
    ESI_CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
    ```

4.  **Build and Run the Bot**
    Use Docker Compose to build the container and run it in the background.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

Your Firehawk bot should now be online and ready to be invited to your Discord server.
