## üìñ What Is This?
Another EVE Online Discord bot‚Äîbecause apparently there aren‚Äôt enough already.  

Written in GO - which was relatively simple. Although this could have been done better the example and code is here for you to use as you wish.

Currently going through 24h testing to ensure the code is robust enough to be hosted.

Inspired by the *actually good* [Firetail Bot](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/firetail-eve-discord-bot/45283).  

*(Proof it sometimes works)*
