Another EVE Online Discord bot, because apparently there aren't enough already. This one is written in Golang (Cos I hate listening to tutorial videos, learn by building damn it), so at least it's fast. Inspired by the actually good [Firetail Bot](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/firetail-eve-discord-bot/45283).

## ‚ú® Features (The Things It Does)

* **Killmail Spam**: Get real-time killmails from `eve-kill.com` piped directly into your channel of choice.
* **Endless Filtering**: Use the ridiculously long list of subscription topics to pretend you're only getting the "important" kills.
* **Mostly Correct Data**: Fetches and caches names for things so you don't have to remember what ID `30000142` is.
* **Server Status**: Tells you if Tranquility is online, so you know who to blame when you can't log in.
* **Character Lookup**: Stalk your  by getting a link to their killboard.

## üöÄ Commands (The Buttons You Can Press)

It's a slash command bot. You know the drill.

| Command                             | Description                                            | Example                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `/status`                           | Checks if the server hamster is still running.         | `/status`                             |
| `/lookup <character_name>`          | Finds a character's public record of shame.            | `/lookup The Mittani`                 |
| `/subscribe <topic> [channel]`      | Starts the firehose of killmails in a channel.         | `/subscribe topic:Big Kills`          |
| `/unsubscribe <topic> [channel]`    | Mercifully stops the firehose.                         | `/unsubscribe topic:All Kills`        |

## üîó How to Get It

It's a public bot. You don't build it, you just invite it and hope for the best.

## üó∫Ô∏è Development Roadmap

A list of things I'll probably get around to building eventually.

### In Progress
* `/price <item_name>`: So you can be disappointed by market prices without logging in.
* `/scout <system_name>`: Get intel on a solar system.
* `/group <name>`: Look up corps and alliances.

### Planned
* Group Lookup: Looks up information about EVE corporations and alliances.
* Location Scout: Provides detailed information about a specific solar system.
* Price: Checks the market price for items in-game.
* Whatever else I feel like doing.
