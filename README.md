# Firehawk Bot 🔥  

---

## 📖 What Is This?
Another EVE Online Discord bot—because apparently there aren’t enough already.  

Written in GO - which was relatively simple. Although this could have been done better the example and code is here for you to use as you wish.

Currently going through 24h testing to ensure the code is robust enough to be hosted.

Inspired by the *actually good* [Firetail Bot](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/firetail-eve-discord-bot/45283).  

*(Proof it sometimes works)*

## ✨ Features
- **Killmail Spam** → Real-time killmails from `eve-kill.com` piped into your channel.  
- **Endless Filtering** → Subscribe to specific killmail topics so you can pretend you only see the “important” ones.  
- **Mostly Correct Data** → Fetches & caches IDs so you don’t have to remember what `30000142` is.  
- **Server Status** → Tells you if Tranquility is alive.  
- **Character Lookup** → Pulls a character’s killboard info.  
- **Group & Alliance Lookup** → Groups and alliances are now supported!  
- **Tools Command** → Lists useful third-party EVE Online tools.  (Feel free to add more)
- **Location Scout** → Info on systems before you blindly jump in (WIP).
